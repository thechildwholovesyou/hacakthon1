With the help of Puppeteer and NodeJS, I have written an automated script which helps an user to get the following details :

1. The covid vaccination centers' current data in his/her district is fetched through an url, which is stored in json format and also an screenshot is generated.

2. The json formatted data is converted into an excel file using nodeJS module.

3. The nearest covid vaccination centre is fetched from google maps , screenshot of map is generated and link of the shortest path is extracted. 

4. Using nodemailer , excel file and screenshot of map and site is mailed to the uers's email address.


HOW TO RUN THIS PROJECT :

STEP 1: Delete all the node modules.

STEP 2: npm i nodejs

STEP 3: nmp i fs

STEP 4: nmp i puppeteer 

STEP 5: npm i xlsx

STEP 6: npm i nodemailer

HURRAY !!! YOU ARE ALL SET TO GO .....
